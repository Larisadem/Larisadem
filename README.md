Hi, I’m Larisa Demjanenko
I'm a passionate learner on a mission to unravel the stories hidden within data.
Aspiring to transition into the scope of business analysis, I've embarked on an exciting journey into the world of Power BI.
This repository is my canvas— a space where I bring data to life, transforming raw numbers into actionable insights.
